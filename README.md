## **Data Cell**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**

To cultivate a collaborative community of aspiring data scientists and AI practitioners, guiding members from foundational machine learning to advanced AI techniques. The Data Cell emphasizes **hands-on learning, real-world projects, and teamwork**, preparing members to tackle practical challenges and innovate in the data-driven world.

**ðŸ—“ Key Activities**

- **Machine Learning Foundations:** A **4-session program** introducing core principles of supervised learning, model training, and evaluation. Concludes with a **guided project on real datasets** to consolidate understanding.
- **Advanced AI Mastery:** A **two-part program** covering deep learning, transfer learning, and NLP with Transformers (3 sessions each). Includes **hands-on projects** such as image classification with pre-trained models and text generation systems.
- **End-to-End AI Systems:** A **5-session program** on building full AI pipelines, from data acquisition to deployment and monitoring. Culminates in a **final project** where members design and present a functional AI solution, with certificates awarded for successful completion.
